## 🔒 Privacy & Minimum Permissions

Battery Plus is built with a strict **offline-first and privacy-focused** philosophy:
* **Zero Data Collection:** The app does not collect, track, analytics-log, or transmit any of your personal or device data.
* **100% Local Storage:** Every single history point, timestamp, and metric is stored securely and exclusively *inside your device's local storage* (`SharedPreferences`). Nothing ever leaves your phone.
* **Minimum Permissions:** The app requests only the bare-minimum system permissions required to read hardware battery states, ensuring a secure and lightweight footprint.
